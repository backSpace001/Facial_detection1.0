# Facial_detection1.0
In this I am basically designing one single API to detect faces and eyes of a person in photos and live cam.
Here I am working in Windows so the following commands is suited for Windows Anaconda command prompt

# import libraries
import cv2
import matplotlib.pyplot
import numpy

Install OpenCV
conda install opencv-python

Install matplotlib.pyplot
conda install matplotlib.pyplot

Install numpy
conda install numpy

I have also mentioned the lines where you have to change the path of the directory as per your location existing directory.
